Leanplum does not support custom modifications to the SDK, without an approved pull request (PR). If you wish to include your changes, please fork the repo and send a PR to the develop branch. After the PR has been reviewed and merged into develop, it will go into our regular release cycle, which includes QA. Once the release process has finished, the PR will be available in master and your changes are now officialy supported by Leanplum.
